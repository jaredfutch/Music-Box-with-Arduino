# Music-Box-with-Arduino
Arduino music with LED and sound with sensor
I used a simple sonar sensor and an LED at the top of a lighthouse and a speaker under the bottom of the lighthouse attached to an Arduino so that when someone walked by the light would beat to the song uploaded and heard from the speaker using Arduino's PWM to produce a wave for the musical note sent to the speaker.
